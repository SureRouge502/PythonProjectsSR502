And thats pretty much it for this version of Myphone! **XD**
It took me months to build this app. Tons of google searchs , tons of editing , tons to error corrections but in the end i think it was all worth it!
We now have a working GUI app of Myphone!




Note:
-----
This is my first GUI app ever. And it goes without saying that there will be some bugs or issues here and there.
Do not hesitate to report me of this. I will take action as soon as i figure out my stuff with it. I gotta say we've come a lot further than how we were in 
the beginning. From going to an app that only show you your screen , to an app which is now easier to use using GUI. Of course the little things matter,
You can still stream audio and Screen of your phone. But since this is a python GUI app, it makes things difficult for me to work on as my older versions 
were completely Bash:Shell based programs. Much easier to use though. Least you dont have to keep typing numbers and selecting options XD. I know how painful
it can be, for i actually made these apps so i could solve a little issue of mine a while ago. Its only because of that, that i got into coding and started 
working on my very own app for this all. Solves the problem and i learnt a new skill too! I know it would've been an overkill saying that i learnt coding
and used it all just coz i had an issue which i could've easily solved by purchasing an app which, well solves it! But no, i went all the way and made sure it
helps everyone who has this issue too!

History aside.... 
a word of notice, This app will now be cross platform!
YES! you read it right. Now, Not only linux users, but macOS and Windows users will be able to use it as well.Turns out windows powershell is useful ,and
powerful, but most importantly , it runs using shell. It makes things a lot easier for me to work on. And for macOS, well its already a Unix Based OS. so
it should be easier right? No idea.... but i will see what i can do and i will asure you of this that i will make this app CrossPlatform.

Well that was it for the documentation part and for the news.. Lets move on to the more useful part XD





Installation:
-------------

---->First give executable permission to the installer file by using :

    chmod +x install.sh

---->Now lets run this installer and its done by :

    ./install.sh

---->The installer will install all the pre-requisites and programs required to run this program efficiently. And also provide them with executable permissions
on its own, so less work and easy installation!

---->After the installation is complete and you've received a message saying "Installation complete", you can run the program for the folder it is in using :

    python3 GUI.py

The package will run using python, coz well, its made using python. And thats it! You can run the app as many times as you want using the command given above.
No need to install the app everytime.


I hope you enjoy using the program!
